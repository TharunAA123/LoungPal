# LoungPal
LoungPal, is a software which helps potential travelers to navigate with ease inside buzzling terminals of an airport. LoungPal has an interactive UI, comprising Login and Sign-up options, a section to choose the start and end points of the journey inside the airport terminal and a main section which houses the dynamic airport map. Once the user is logged in, he/she can search the path from a location, where the user is standing, to the location where he/she intends to go. The user can give the nearest service that is visible as the “source” location and give the service that he/she wishes to utilize in the “destination” location. The application will guide the user to the location that he/she intends to go by showing the path in the terminal map, as per the path stored in the application database. This is done by highlighting the relevant cells of the grid that is embedded into the map.
